Welcome to the ultimate hands-on guide for learning **Ontology Engineering** using the famous `pizza.owl` tutorial. This repository is designed to take you from a complete beginner to an advanced user of **Protégé**, the world’s most popular ontology editor.

## 🌟 Why Learn Ontology & Protégé?
In the era of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), **Ontologies** provide the structured "world knowledge" that machines need to reason. By mastering this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Define complex hierarchies and relationships.
- Use **Reasoners** to automatically classify data.
- Write **SWRL** rules to add intelligent logic.
- Build the backbone of **Knowledge Graphs**.

## 🎓 The Learning Path
This repository is a companion to my **comprehensive video course**. I recommend following the videos while using the snapshot models in this repo to check your work.

## 🛠 Repository Structure
I have tracked my progress step-by-step. You can jump into any stage of the tutorial by using the files in:
- `/snapshot_models`: RDF/OWL files at various stages of the tutorial.
- `/ontology_ref`: Reference materials and SHACL shapes.
- `Protege 5 New OWL Pizza Tutorial V3.2.pdf`: The core manual based on Michael DeBellis' guide.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Setup
- Download [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
- Install a reasoner like **HermiT** or **Pellet** (included in most Protégé versions).

### 2. Modules & Curriculum
| Phase | Topics Covered | Key Videos |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundations** | Classes, Subclasses, and Disjointness | 01 - 09 |
| **Properties** | Object Properties, Domains, and Ranges | 10 - 13 |
| **Logic** | Existential & Universal Restrictions | 14 - 24 |
| **Advanced** | SWRL Rules, SPARQL Queries, and SHACL | 37 - 42 |
| **Cloud** | WebProtégé & WebVOWL | 43 - 45 |

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- **Taxonomies vs. Ontologies:** Moving beyond simple hierarchies to complex logic.
- **Open World Assumption:** Understanding how OWL reasoning differs from traditional databases.
- **Description Logic (DL):** Learning to query your knowledge base effectively.
- **SWRL & SQWRL:** Adding "If-Then" rules to your ontology.

## 🔗 Resources & Credits
- **Original Guide:** Based on Michael DeBellis' excellent Protégé OWL tutorial.
- **Mind Map:** Use the [pizza.owl tutorial.mm](./pizza.owl%20tutorial.mm) (Open with FreePlane) for a visual overview.
- **Visualization:** View the model via [WebVOWL](https://yasenstar.github.io/protege_pizza/).
